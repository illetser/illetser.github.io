        <h1>Hi there! I'm James.</h1>
          <p>Thank you for visiting my site. I currently live in Chicago where I help companies find their most important asset, their people.</p>
          <p> My main motivations are: (1) to be with my family and people I care about, (2) to do something fun, exciting, and impactful, and (3) to pursue a long-term career in entrepreneurship, where I can build companies that change the way the world works.</p>
          <p>Originally from St. Louis, I attended St. Louis Priory High School and graduated in 2004. I played varsity hockey, golf, and football.</p>
          <p>I then attended Villanova University in Philadelphia, PA where I studied International Business, Management, and Entrepreneurship. During my time at Nova, I also was a four-year starting golatender on their Division I ECHA ice hockey team.</p>

        <h1>Professional Summary</h1>
          <p>After graduating in 2008, I moved back to St. Louis where I started working at DHR International, a global executive search firm. I joined as an Associate in the Private Equity/Venture Capital Practice where I supported the Managing Director in executive C-level search projects for PE-backed portfolio companies.</p>
          <p>In 2010, I was transferred to the global headquarters in Chicago and promoted to Senior Associate. I spent the next year in a similar capacity, yet had more autonomy in managing and executive the various search assignments.</p>
          <p>In mid-2011, I was offered a tremendous opportunity to move to Hong Kong as an expatriate. It was a two-year assignment to serve as the Talent Acquisition Director for Asia/Pacific responsible for developing and deplying the firm's regional growth strategy across Asia. These 2+ years in Hong Kong were arguably the most rewarding years of my life to date, both professionally and personally. After my assignment in late 2013, I made the difficult decision to leave DHR International and pursue my entrpreneurial passion with an early-stage technology startup.</p>
          <p>Before returning to the U.S. in late-2013, I took a two-month sabattical and traveled to Bali, Indonesia and Costa Rica. After coming back to reality, I joined Groove Technologies, an early-stage technology startup. For the next two years, I worked with the co-founders to develop a new enterprise recruiting platform and native mobile app where candidates could browse and rate new opportunities. We successfully raised a $1M seed round and moved the HQ to San Francisco, CA. At that time, I learned I was accepted to Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management and was therefore unable to relocate to SF. So, in July 2015, I joined CareerBuilder as an Enterprise Account Executive partnering with Fortune 500 organizations to improve talent acquisition processes and leverage software and data to improve recruiter efficiencies.</p>
          <p>Outside of work and school, I enjoy spending my time on the ice at Johnny's Ice House downtown where I play in a competitive men's league. I also serve as the Co-President of the Villanova's Alumni Association Chicago Chapter.</p>
